    <li>2 ½ cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon organic sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    <li>1 cup vegan butter, cubed and chilled</li>
    <li>6 tablespoons ice water</li>
  </ul>

  <li>2 cups organic sugar, plus 1 teaspoon, divided</li>
  <li>1 lemon, zested</li>
  <li>5 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
  <li>½ lemon, juiced</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon coconut oil, melted, plus 1 teaspoon, divided</li>
  <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
  <li>4 teaspoons cinnamon, divided</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><u><strong>Instructions</strong></u></strong></h3>

  <ol>
    <li>Make the crust: In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, and salt.</li>
    <li>Add the cubed butter, a bit at a time, and use a fork to work it into the flour with a fork until it breaks down to dime-sized pieces.</li>
    <li>Gradually add the ice water and mix just until the dough can be pressed together.</li>
    <li>Divide the dough in half and shape into discs. Wrap in plastic wrap and chill in the fridge for 1 hour.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350˚F (180˚C).</li>
    <li>Make the filling: Peel and core apples, then thinly slice. Transfer to a large bowl and add 2 cups (200 G) of sugar, the lemon zest, cornstarch, lemon juice, 1 teaspoon melted coconut oil, salt, and 3 teaspoons cinnamon. Toss until the apples are well-coated. Set aside.</li>
    <li>On a lightly floured surface, roll out both of the discs of dough to about 1 inch (2 cm) thick. Transfer one round to a greased 8-inch (20-cm) pie dish and gently press against the bottom and sides. Trim the excess dough around the edges, then prick the bottom of the pie crust all over with a fork</li>
    <li>Pour the apples into the bottom crust and cover with the top crust. Trim the excess dough around the edges, then crimp the top and bottom crusts together with a fork. Brush the top of the crust with the remaining tablespoon of melted coconut oil and sprinkle with the remaining teaspoon of sugar and cinnamon. Cut 4 vents in the top crust</li>
    <li>Bake for 1 hour, until crust is starting to turn golden brown.</li>
    <li>Let cool for 10 minutes, then slice and serve.</li>
    <li>Enjoy!</li>
